Incident and emergency management refers to the standardized approach, to be at times of emergency.

The team is also conferred the duty of preparing standards, which are to be followed, during such incidents. Such Incident management teams often rely on third party services and hardware for performing their duties. Emergency management can also be termed as disaster management and mostly relates to the large scale disasters, such as those caused by nature, terrorist activities and industrial accidents among others.
