<strong>PARP (Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase) Inhibitor Market Snapshot 2025-2033 provides a concise overview of market trends, forecasts, and growth opportunities over the forecast period:</strong>

PARP means poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP] -ribose) polymerase. It is a family of 17 enzymes that combine several (poly) units of ADP-ribose in a chain (the PAR chain) and transfers them to the target proteins. This helps to restore DNA when it is damaged. DNA can be damaged by many factors, including exposure to UV rays, radiation, some anti-cancer drugs or other substances in the environment. PARP inhibitors block an enzyme critical to the repair of single stranded breaks in DNA. Inhibition of this DNA repair enzyme can lead to cell death, particularly in cancer cells that carry deficiency in other DNA repair pathways.
